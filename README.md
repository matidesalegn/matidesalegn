Hi there, I'm Matiwos Desalegn 👋
Data Engineer | ML(GenAI) Enthusiast | Software Developer


🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate Data Engineer and Software Developer with a focus on building scalable data pipelines, leveraging Machine Learning and Generative AI, and creating robust software solutions. With a BSc in Electrical & Computer Engineering (Computer Stream) from Wolaita Sodo University, I specialize in:

Data Engineering: Designing and optimizing ETL/ELT pipelines, data lakehouses, and real-time ingestion systems using tools like Mage AI, AWS (S3, Athena, Glue, Lambda), and Apache Spark.

Machine Learning & GenAI: Developing predictive models, fraud detection systems, and AI-powered chatbots with Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Groq's LLM via LangChain.

Software Development: Building RESTful APIs and full-stack applications with FastAPI, Next.js, and containerized deployments using Docker and Kubernetes.

Web Scraping & Automation: Creating efficient data acquisition systems with Selenium, HTTPX, and BeautifulSoup.

DevOps & Cloud: Automating workflows with GitHub Actions, CI/CD, and deploying scalable solutions on AWS (EKS, ECS, EC2).

Let's connect to build innovative, data-driven solutions! 🚀

🔭 I’m currently working on scalable data pipelines, GenAI-powered applications, and real-time analytics.
